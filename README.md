This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. Built using modern web technologies, the site showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a MERN stack developer. Itâ€™s designed to provide a clean, responsive user experience with interactive features and dynamic content.

Technologies Used:
- HTML5 & CSS3 for structure and styling.
- Tailwind CSS for a modern, utility-first design
- React.js for building dynamic and interactive UI components
- Node.js and Express.js for server-side functionality
- Firebase for authentication and database management
- MongoDB for scalable, NoSQL database solutions

Feel free to explore the code and see how I build and organize web applications. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
